These are known bugs in afpfs-ng 0.8:

- if afpfsd isnt' running, and you run an 'afp_client exit', it restarts it
  and then kills it

- files with '/' in them can't be accessed

- for the fuse client, when you have multiple servers that are connected, 
  if you unmount anything other than the last one, you may ruin the 
  other mounts.

- If you're not using a common user directory, chgrp may have problems

- On occasion, when doing a mount with the fuse client, there can be a 
  delay of 10 seconds.

- there are some locking problems with FUSE which can cause a halted
  filesystem under heavy traffic loads

- on Mac OS X, gcrypt 1.4.0 or later is required.  1.2.4 has a dynamic linker
  bug which will break afpfs-ng whenver gcrypt functions are called.

- on file get and put, we don't really pay attention to tx and rx quantums.
  This can make for inefficient transfers.

- FreeBSD has quite a few problems with it; the port is simply incomplete.
  Among the problems:
  - the fuse implementation is totaly untested, you will need to manually
    start up the daemon (afpfsd) 
  - there can be some long delays when initiating connections

- on some clients, such as afpgetstatus, ^C won't work

- file names are limited to 255 characters, whereas AFP >= 3.0 handles
  infinite lengths


Coding:

- cplusplus in include files
- make install should install include files
- remove init_uams
- remove midlevel.h
- move statvfs out of volume struct
- always starting up /usr/local/bin/afpfsd
- redo findserverbyname
- unmount doesn't do so by volumename
- support FUSE directio
- check netatalk upriv
- slow startup of afpfsd
- slow fuse mounts
- need to not require fuse
- does 'afp_client' with a uam work?
- can status text overrun? afp_status_header
- check process table for afpfsd before relaunching
- status output has 'mounted'
- fix building witout fuse
- we always disconnect on detach
- problem with filename lengths
- problem with forced_ending_hook checking servers still in use
- fuse_clients need locking
- escape around /usr/bin/afpfs, docs
- long lists of volumes for stateless
- sometimes readdir doesn't get whole list first time
- stat errors for ENOENT
- get include files to be installed
- what is fp->fileid?
- why do we need path as a paramater to ml_close()?
- can't handle resource forks with afp_sl_*
- showProgressInfo for KDE
- manpages misspell "No User Authent"
- create lsm file
- get rid of private
- redo afp_get_address to use URL
- handle addresses of servers properly
- double afp_server_remove in connect.c?
- the way we encode versions is strange
- rename afp_print_url to afp_url_print
- in sl_connect, get ride of conn->print()
- add i18n support for messages
- add live hooks for login sequence
- handle situation where we need to prompt for a volume password (using
  fpgetsrvrparms)
- use or get rid of shmem
- support guest access for non-cleartxt volpasswords (eg. airport)
- rename all protocol functions to afp_proto_*
- unix perms incorrectly calculated on AEBS
- signal handling is horked
- non-unixprivs netatalk doesn't work
- afp_sl_stat doesn't give full afp_file_info_basic, just stat
- in client.c, check return value of afp_sl_mount()
- PATH_MAX not set on all hosts
- mount_afp appears to just connect, not mount
- use pthread_join instead of mutexes in some cases
- semaphore around remove_client, etc.
- make abritrary volume lengths, in volopen
- leaking fd
- rename trigger_exit
- in fuse_mount, use pthread_join instead of semaphore
- deal with situation better where use afp_client mount instead of mount_afp 
- split daemon_client.c to separate out fuse components
- in afp_client, if timeout, help is shown.
- in mount_afp, if help is shown, it is from afp_client
- unlimited path lengths in FUSE 2.8
- fix fstab
- make afpfsd report uid, warn if it is running as root
- make sure -d ends up in daemon_fuse.c
- use preprocessor macro in daemon_client.c
- connec ttimeouts can't possibly work in afp_server_full_connect, ret is
  never set.
- guess if you're using URL syntax with afp_client

- when you run 'exit', don't first startup afpfsd.  same with help.
- if you don't have perms set properly on fusermount, there's no complaint.
- what happens when you run mount_afp afp://.../ without a mntpoint or
  volumename?
- for extremez-ip, server type gets shortened, "type: Windows Version"
- get : ret from process_client_fds: 0\n not found, after 10 times?
- FUSE_USE_VERSION is statically set, weird
- fist doing an afp_extra connect to localhost, then a afp_cmd mount with
  127.0.0.1 just hangs
- if there's a stale mount, error on mount is a perm issue, maybe we can do
  better
- untarring file doesn't always work (tmp.tar.bz2)
- get rid of global_volume in fuse_int.c?
- status gives " Volume Test Volume, id 0, attribs 0x0 flags 0xffffff80 mounted: No"
	what is up with flags?
- with afpcmd, on MBP server, "Specify a volume with 'cd volume'. Choose one of: ?,??s%?"
